        Makes REST API request and returns a promise that resolves to the response.

        @param request
            JSON object with properties:
            'url'     (String, required) The Salesforce REST endpoint to call.
            'method'  (String, optional) The http method like 'get' or 'post'. Default is 'get'.
            'body'    (String, optional) The request body, varies by the endpoint you're calling.
            'headers' (Map, optional)    String key-value pairs of http headers to send.
                                         Default is { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' }.
                                         Your headers are merged with the default headers,
                                         overwriting any existing keys.

        Example usage:
            component.find( 'lcAPI' ).restRequest({
                'url' : '/services/data/v44.0/sobjects/Account',
                'method' : 'post',
                'body' : JSON.stringify({
                    'Name' : 'Salesforce',
                    'BillingStreet' : '1 Market Street',
                    'BillingCity' : 'San Francisco',
                    'BillingState' : 'CA'
                }),
                'headers' : {
                    'Sforce-Query-Options' : 'batchSize=200'
                }
            }).then( $A.getCallback( function( response ) {
                // handle response
            })).catch( $A.getCallback( function( err ) {
                // handle error
            }));
